In conclusion, from the data collected I was able to see the difference in the district and chartered high schools and compare it to the amount of students they have and compare it to factors such as the total school budget, Per student budget. 
There were also notable patterns in relationship to the Average math and Reading scores such as the Chartered schools majorly had the higher average in comparison to the District High Schools.


Some comparisons I noticed were that the grades that students got in maths were notably worse than their English scores. An interesting observation was all the bottom schools were from a District School type while all the top average schools came from a chartered school. 
Another observation is that students did not have to spend more money to learn to do better as students who paid the highest did the worst.
